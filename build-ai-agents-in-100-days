# 🧠 100 Days of AI Agents

Welcome to my **100-day journey to master and build AI agents** — from basics to autonomous, multi-agent systems.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To design, code, and document 100 mini-projects or concepts around AI Agents using frameworks like **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **CrewAI**, and **OpenAI GPTs**.

## 🗓️ Progress Tracker

| Day | Topic | Highlights | Status |
|-----|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Intro to Agents | Building a minimal agent loop | ✅ |
| 2 | Adding Memory | Using LangChain’s memory | ✅ |
| 3 | Tools and Actions | Integrating external APIs | 🔄 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- LangChain / LlamaIndex / CrewAI
- OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini APIs
- FastAPI (for agent endpoints)
- Streamlit (for demos)

---

## 📚 Reference Projects
- `trading_agent/` – executes BTC trade logic autonomously  
- `chatbot_with_memory/` – chat agent with short + long-term memory  
- `autonomous_researcher/` – multi-agent system that summarizes and plans

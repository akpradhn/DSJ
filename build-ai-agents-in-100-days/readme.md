# 🧠 100 Days of AI Agents

Welcome to my **100-day journey to master and build AI agents** — from basics to autonomous, multi-agent systems.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To design, code, and document 100 mini-projects or concepts around AI Agents using frameworks like **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **CrewAI**, **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and AI APIs from **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Google**.

## 🗓️ Progress Tracker

| Day | Topic | Highlights | Status |
|-----|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Intro to Agents | Building a minimal agent loop | ✅ |
| 2 | Adding Memory | Using LangChain's memory | ⏳ |
| 3 | Tools and Actions | Integrating external APIs | ⏳ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
